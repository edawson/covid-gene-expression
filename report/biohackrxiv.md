# Introduction

As part of the virtual BioHackathon 2020, we formed a working group that focused on the analysis of gene expression in the context of COVID-19. More specifically, we performed transcriptome analyses on published datasets in order to better understand the interaction between human host and virus.

The ideas proposed during this hackathon where divided into five projects:

1. SARS-CoV-2 infection global analyses, which dealt with global gene expression, functional and regulation of gene expression analyses.
2. Human-virus interaction analyses, which aimed to pinpoint RNA-binding proteins that might be key in the interaction between human and SARS-CoV-2.
3. Increased risk factors analyses, which investigated gene expression in other datasets with the goal of identifying commonalities and differences with previous analyses, focusing on specific genes.
4. Subtyping of expression response to drugs after COVID infection, which focused on trying to search for potential drugs that could impact in important genes for the interaction of human and virus.
5. Reporting findings to electronic medical records, which was conceived to determine how to bring the results obtained to clinical practice.

The people behind BioHackrXiv has participated on multiple BioHackathons organized by National Bioscience Database Center (NBDC) / Database Center for Life Science (DBCLS) in Japan and ELIXIR Europe. We decided to create BioHackrXiv preprint in order to make it easier for all to share and report on the work done at this sort of events. Of course, any hacking event is welcome to publish here, the more the merrier they say! And, if you want to go for a more formal peer-reviewed publication, you can always do so once your work is more mature [@Katayamaetal-2010].

## Level 2

Text

### Subsection level 3

Please keep sections to a maximum of three levels.

## Background

Biological background [@prins2020].  


## Tables, figures and so on

Please remember to introduce tables (see Table 1) before they appear on the document. We recommend to center tables, formulas and figure but not the corresponding captions. Feel free to modify the table style as it better suits to your data.

<TODO add table>

Remember to introduce figures (see Figure 1) before they appear on the document. 

<TODO add figure>

# Other main section on your manuscript level 1

Feel free to use numbered lists or bullet points as you need.
* Item 1
* Item 2

# Discussion and/or Conclusion

We recommend to include some discussion or conclusion about your work. Feel free to modify the section title as it fits better to your manuscript.

# Future work

And maybe you want to add a sentence or two on how you plan to continue. Please keep reading to learn about citations and references.

For citations of references, we prefer the use of parenthesis, last name and year. If you use a citation manager, Elsevier – Harvard or American Psychological Association (APA) will work. If you are referencing web pages, software or so, please do so in the same way. Whenever possible, add authors and year. We have included a couple of citations along this document for you to get the idea. Please remember to always add DOI whenever available, if not possible, please provide alternative URLs. You will end up with an alphabetical order list by authors’ last name.

# GitHub repositories and docker images

* Please add a list here
* Make sure you let us know which of these correspond to Jupyter notebooks. Although not supported yet, we plan to add features for them
* And remember, software and data need a license for them to be used by others, no license means no clear rules so nobody could legally use a non-licensed research object, whatever that object is
